Synops of Knuth's Art Of Computer Programming

### My favorite quotes
Basic Concepts, page 32 after deriving the formulas of arithmetic/geometic progression:
> Notice that we have derived the importnat equations (13), (14) and (15) purely by using simple manipulations of sums.
> Most textbooks would simply *state* those formulas, and prove them by *induction*. 
> Induction is, of course, a perfectly valid procedure; but **it does not give any insight into how on earth a person would ever have
> dreamed the formula up in the first place, except by some lucky guess**. In the analysis of algorithms we are confronted with hundreds of sums that do not 
> conform to any apparent pattern; by manipulating those sums, as above, we can often get the answer
> **without the need for ingenious guesses**
